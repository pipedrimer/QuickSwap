QUICKSWAP

QuickSwap is a decentralized NFT barter marketplace built on Solana, designed to facilitate direct peer-to-peer NFT trades. Users can propose and accept trades involving NFT-for-NFT swaps, or include SOL to balance the value of deals. By eliminating intermediaries, QuickSwap aims to provide a trustless, low-fee environment where collectors and traders can negotiate creative and flexible deals. The platform aim to evolve to support features like trait/rarity-based filtering and automated matching.
